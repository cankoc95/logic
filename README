logic ucb is a simpler version of a much more known language "prologue" and was developed using python3.
logic is a declarative programming language that essentially has two functions
	1- fact	
	2- query

The work principal is : based on the facts you declare, you can ask queries.
Logic uses the scheme interpreter i have built because in logic every 'relation' is a scheme list.

To find the facts , query follows a two step process and the steps are : Search and Unify
